# Writing an Interpreter in Go

I am sad that I did not take a class in compilers when I was in college. This is an attempt to fix that innate sadness.

I will write an interpreter for this language called **Monkey**.

Also, as an additional challenge, I will write this with Vim bindings. I first learnt about Vim in my OOP class in college. Since that course, I have not really used Vim since, except for the occasional file edits on the terminal. I hope this project will help me understand whether I really want to commit to learning Vim and lean into it.
